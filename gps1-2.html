    <h1>GPS 1.2 Sample Website</h1>

    <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
    <p>Pair programming consist of a driver and navigator, where both individuals are     helping each other out and learning from each other as they code. They both sit at     one workstation to collaborate and switch roles throughout the project.</p>

    <h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
    <p>Pair programming is important to DBC because it is the main culture at DBC. Pair programming plays a critcal role in the software industry overall. It is one the most efficient ways to learn from your peers, colleagues, and friends. It helps the pair stay motivated throughout the project, and it makes it a lot easier to pinpoint mistakes/problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
    <p>Both roles have their own tasks, but they depend on each other in order for it to work. If one needs help or runs into a roadblock then the other can step in and help at anypoint of the journey. The driver is the one who works the steering wheel and pedals as the navigator guides the driver when to turn or when to stop.</p>

<h2>David's Reflection</h2>
<p>Well, this wasn't my first pairing but as always, the GPS pair programming sessions have been extremely beneficial to helping me solidify the curriculum I had to learn the week before. I enjoy these pairing sessions because it helps to interact and speak your mind openly. We had some issues centering the images to our liking but after collaborating on the issue we were able to come up with a sollution by creating a division tag around the images.

<h2>Sagar's Reflection</h2>
<p>This was not my first time pairing.It was definetly a great session. I got to 
learn a few things from my peer. I really enjoyed it as well. Our website looks 
exactly like the wireframe. So that was good. We also had a roadbloack on centering the images but we figured it out. Overall, It was a great experince.</p>

#U1.W3: Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

## Learning Competencies
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
- Compare integers and floats
- Identify and use strings
- Define local variables

## Summary
For these challenges you will want to read the chapters and actually do what he says even though much of it will probably be review from your pre-interview prep work. It's good to get it in your fingers and get used to typing these commands and strange symbols.

In this challenge you will go through basic mathematical operations.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 2: Numbers
You may want to save everything in Sublime, or you can go in to your terminal and type `irb`. This stands for "<strong>i</strong>nteractive <strong>r</strong>u<strong>b</strong>y." (cute huh?) You can simply type any of these commands in what is essentially a ruby sandbox and see the output.

For example

```ruby
~ :> irb
irb(main):001:0> 1+2
=> 3
irb(main):002:0>
```


## Release 1: Summarize
Go to the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file associated with this challenge. Go to the numbers section and answer the questions in the "summary" section.

## Release 2: Try it!
In section 2.5, Pine provides two great mini-challenges. Create these two programs and paste your code into the ruby section in your [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

**Mini-challenges**
Write a program that calculates and outputs the:
- Hours in a year
- Minutes in a decade

## Release 3: Read Ch.3 Letters

Pay close attention, but you won't need to do any exercises based on this chapter.

## Release 4: Read Ch. 4 Variables and Assignment
Again, follow along and take a few notes (if you're that type of person) on variable assignment.

## Release 5: Mini-challenges
Navigate to the following directories within this folder. Each has a README with instructions for how to do the challenge, a my_solution.rb file where you should put your work, and a spec file with tests to run.

- [Defining Variables #1](1-defining-variables)
- [Simple String Methods](2-simple-string-methods)
- [Local Variables and Basic Arithmetical Operations](3-local-variables)


## Release 6: Reflect
Using the [Reflection Guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md), reflect on what you learned. Write your response in the "Reflection" section of your my_solution.md file.

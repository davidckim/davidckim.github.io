			<div id="title">Productivity with Adderall</div>

					<p>Okay, so you're new to tech, but most likely you have seen the new popular HBO comedy 'Silicon Valley' that every keeps raving about. The show isn't too far off when it comes to mimicking what these "hacker homes" are doing in Palo Alto. Programmers work long and hard hours, and some seem to agree that working at night has given them the most productive results. The problem with many tech companies these days is the behavior that masks behind the programmers. It's not unheard of to have 60-80 hour shifts trying to churn out a project on time or debug a block of code. 80 hours a week is a long shift, but when adderall is involved, the hours are easy. There is a lot of pressure to meet deadlines. Deadlines are what programmers live and die by. This cultural norm in the tech industry, creates a fast-paced work environment and those are the type of people they are looking to hire in the industry. 
				Taking Adderall when it isn't prescribed or if the user does not have ADHD, can cause major side effects. Being too dependent on adderall will make your work production drop a whole lot when you are trying to work without the drug. Once you go on it, you won't be able to work without it.</p>

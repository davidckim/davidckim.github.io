					<p>Hashes are a lot more flexible between the two. When it comes to speed in finding a specific object, the search with a hash is a lot faster. Programmers will use hashes when they need to map a value with a specific name or string, hence the flexibility. Although, you have to keep in mind that hashes aren't distributed as ordered data, but they are distributed as insertion order. The best times to use hashes are when you need to name parameters in a function. It just creates a cleaner look for your code.</p>

					<p>Arrays are mostly just ordered objects that are indexed by integers, which with hashes you can index it by any string. When you define a method with multiple arguments and objects, they often return the data as an Array. When trying to reference an object in an array, the positions are stored as integers starting from 0. For example let's say you have an array with multiple values: football_teams['broncos', 'chargers', 'chiefs, 'raiders'] If you wanted to reference to 'broncos' you would type football_teams[0]. For the 'Chiefs' you would type football_teams[2]. </p>

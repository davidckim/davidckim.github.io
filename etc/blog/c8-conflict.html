					<div id="content">
					<p>As a kid, I had problems holding in my temper. I wouldn't say I was a brat, I just had a hard time being passive. But I usually had a legitimate reason to get mad. Today, I am usually a peacekeeper among my friends when conflicts arise and I would usually be successful in defusing the situation. I try to be extremely rational and fair when theres conflict so that way I don't let my emotions get the best of me.</p>
					<p> I have some hot-headed friends, so sometimes when we go out for the evening to a bar or a club, they put on a different face in which they try to play the tough guy card. Which means any small shoulder bump or a if they are given the wrong look by someone, they would try to start something. The way I usually diffuse these situations is by pleading my friends as drunkards and usually the bystander would understand. Using rational methods work most of the time. You have to remember that people are pretty understanding if you give them a chance to be.</p>

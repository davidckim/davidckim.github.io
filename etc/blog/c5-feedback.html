			<div id="title">Pair Programming: A Hassle or Asset? </div> <!-- insert title here -->

					<p>My initial reaction when I heard that pair programming was mandatory in Dev Bootcamp wasn't a good one. I dreaded at the idea of having to speak my mind openly and clearly to an individual I barely knew. All sorts of fears started to overcome my mind and I became sort of a cynic of it. I didn't understand how it would benefit me particularly and thought it would only become a hassle to those who already understand the curriculum really well, to which would slow them down if they were pairing with someone who didn't understand it as well. I underestimated the culture of DBC and how well they recruit the students they want attending their institution. The more I paired, the more I realized how essential it was to our learning process. Pairing with my peers as we tackled the weekly challenges became something I looked forward to rather than working on them on my own. The concept of being able to feed on each others ideas and keep the momentum going creates a whole new environment to programming. The workload is distributed and the pressure is lessened because the weight is shared. Now, I'm not saying all my pair sessions were great, but even having a bad pairing allows you to understand yourself a bit better. It allows you to know what type of person with what learning style, fits best with your pairing.</p>
					<p>Dev Bootcamp's pairing and feedback system is unique and very effective. Giving and receiving feedback not only helps you to structure yourself in a better more effecient way, it also teaches you how to be more efficient in giving advice to others. Simply stating what is wrong and right isn't giving feedback, this approach is too subjective. Giving feedback means, giving facts and results, letting them know what worked BETTER than the other methods. This generates a huge boost in your Emotional Intelligence which is good because EQ is highly sought after at DBC, and rightfully so. Receiving feedback has been helpful to my learning because it allows me to become a better and more efficient pairing partner.</p>

					<div id="content">
					<p>When I think back to the times where I've been the proudest and happiest with myself, it's always the times where I've been a leader and was able to inspire people around me. Our society is molded by great leaders, being a greater leader doesn't neccessarily mean they were leading for the greater good. I would like to use Adolf Hitler in examples for great leadership because he truly was a great leader because he was able to have people believe in him even though it wasn't for a good cause.</p>
					<p>I have always had leadership qualities growing up, from doing group projects to team sports. Being able to inspire and motivate people is a great feeling because it just takes that much effort to push someone forward. That inspiration could be the difference between success and failure in someone's life.

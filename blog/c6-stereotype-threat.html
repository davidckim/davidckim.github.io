					<div id="content">
					<p>Everyone needs to to remember when they are approaching something entirely foreign from their nature, that everyone and everything has to start somewhere. Stereotype threat, also known as imposter syndrome, is a wide known phenomenon which individuals have convinced themselves that whenever they have a flash of success and/or brilliance, it is all due to luck. Sterotype threat is very harmful to a diverse work environment because it creates a threat in which the targeted groups of people are likely to confirm those negative stereotypes. This threat is often found in minorities and it continues to plague our nation. You will often hear about friends or associates who will say that they were the first in their family to attend and finish college. Those who are plagued by stereotype will often have the mentality of a fixed mindset, in which they believe they will never be able to succeed because of the applied stereotypes and historical evidence. 
					</p>
					<p>A number of years ago, I thought I was stigmatized by others because I never did well in school. I created an illusion formyself that I wasn't ever capable enough. I was able to convince myself that I would never amount to anything because of the constant failures in my life. I was able to shake off these toxic way of thinking by exercising and reading a lot of books. Everything you percieve in life is just a mindset and a perspective. If you don't change the way you think, you will never change yourself for the better.

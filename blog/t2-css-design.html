					<p>To any developer's eye, every element in html are seen as boxes. Hence the picture you see below, which is known as the "box model". The box model is a good thing to know when you are positioning or making changes to the actual content. Starting from the center, the content is the part of the element in which the images and text appears. The padding is the clear area in between the content and the border. The Order is the area that goes around the padding and content which keeps everything in a box. And finally, the margin is the clear area outside the border which can almost be seen as the "padding" outside everything else.</p>

					<p>Some people may ask when is the appropriate time to use margin instead of padding or vice versa. One thing you have to understand is that padding is actually considered to be part of the element. Which means it that padding is prone to collapsing when other elements are trying to do so. Since margins are the clear areas outside the element itself, they don't neccessarily act as a solidified content. For example if two elements were sitting next to each other with the same pixels of margin, lets say 5px. The distances between these two elements will only be 5px and not a combined 10px. Why? Because the margins just overlap, they don't bump each other around.</p>

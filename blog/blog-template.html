			<div id="title">Productivity with Adderall</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">10/12/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content">
					<p>Okay, so you're new to tech, but most likely you have seen the new popular HBO comedy 'Silicon Valley' that every keeps raving about. The show isn't too far off when it comes to mimicking what these "hacker homes" are doing in Palo Alto. Programmers work long and hard hours, and some seem to agree that working at night has given them the most productive results. The problem with many tech companies these days is the behavior that masks behind the programmers. It's not unheard of to have 60-80 hour shifts trying to churn out a project on time or debug a block of code. 80 hours a week is a long shift, but when adderall is involved, the hours are easy. There is a lot of pressure to meet deadlines. Deadlines are what programmers live and die by. This cultural norm in the tech industry, creates a fast-paced work environment and those are the type of people they are looking to hire in the industry. 
				Taking Adderall when it isn't prescribed or if the user does not have ADHD, can cause major side effects. Being too dependent on adderall will make your work production drop a whole lot when you are trying to work without the drug. Once you go on it, you won't be able to work without it.</p>

		<div id="title">Enumerable group_by</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">10/12/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content">
					<p>group_by is a ruby method that was introduced in version 1.9. The group_me method interates through the array, checking each element to the block of code. Take this code for example: (0..30).group_By {|n| n % 3}. The numbers 0 through 30 are first passed through the block then they are assigned an integer. Then they are grouped by the result value of the block of code. In this case, they would grouped by the remainder they receive, starting from the numbers that have no remainder and are divided perfectly by 3. You can get pretty creative with how you approach the use of group_me, for example you can use the group_me method to group the arrays by the length of the string.

		<div id="title">My Style of Thinking</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">10/05/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content">
					<p>I am a abstract random and concrete random thinker. In a way, these two different kind of styles of thinking contradict each other, but I wouldn't say that I am two-face, it just means I am flexible in the way I approach things... hopefully. From what I read up on so far, an abstract random learner enjoys working in groups in noncompetitive atmospheres but concrete random learners are competitive and rather work independently. In some ways, this actually makes perfect sense to me. I often have struggles with my tendencies and motivation week by week and it can either be an abstract random learning or concrete learning. When I first found out what my learning styles were, I sat there scratching my head wondering how I could be two very different learning styles that clearly contradict each other. But when I started looking deeper into it, they are in some ways pretty similar. Concrete random learners like producing imaginative products, which is in some ways similar to abstract random thinkers who have imaginativve artistic expression.</p>
					<p>My biggest struggle so far in Phase 0 DBC has been trying to cram everything in such a short period of time. My biggest motivation so far has been trying not to fall behind. Seeing how our cohort has so many brilliant minds, falling behind is as real as it gets. I see my fellow cohort members as my colleagues and family who will go through the same struggles as I do, but they are also my competition. (BOOM! Abstract random and concrete random in action.)</p>

		<div id="title">Use Arrays and Hashes the Right Way</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">10/04/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content">
					<p>Hashes are a lot more flexible between the two. When it comes to speed in finding a specific object, the search with a hash is a lot faster. Programmers will use hashes when they need to map a value with a specific name or string, hence the flexibility. Although, you have to keep in mind that hashes aren't distributed as ordered data, but they are distributed as insertion order. The best times to use hashes are when you need to name parameters in a function. It just creates a cleaner look for your code.</p>

					<p>Arrays are mostly just ordered objects that are indexed by integers, which with hashes you can index it by any string. When you define a method with multiple arguments and objects, they often return the data as an Array. When trying to reference an object in an array, the positions are stored as integers starting from 0. For example let's say you have an array with multiple values: football_teams['broncos', 'chargers', 'chiefs, 'raiders'] If you wanted to reference to 'broncos' you would type football_teams[0]. For the 'Chiefs' you would type football_teams[2]. </p>

		<div id="title">Layers Upon Layers. Understanding Margin, Border, and Padding</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">9/27/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content">
					<p>To any developer's eye, every element in html are seen as boxes. Hence the picture you see below, which is known as the "box model". The box model is a good thing to know when you are positioning or making changes to the actual content. Starting from the center, the content is the part of the element in which the images and text appears. The padding is the clear area in between the content and the border. The border is the area that goes around the padding and content which keeps everything in a box. And finally, the margin is the clear area outside the border which can almost be seen as the "padding" outside everything else.</p>
					<p><img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif"/></p>
					<p>A common question asked is when is the appropriate time to use margin instead of padding or vice versa. One thing you have to understand is that padding is actually considered to be part of the element. Which means that padding is NOT prone to collapsing when other elements are trying to do so. Margins a little different. Since margins are the clear areas outside the element itself, they don't neccessarily act as solidified content. For example if two elements were sitting next to each other with the same pixels of margin, lets say 5px. The distances between these two elements will only be 5px and not a combined 10px. Why? Because the margins just overlap, they don't bump each other around.</p>

		<div id="title">DBC Kitchen vs. Table</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">9/19/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content"><p>Dev Bootcamp has an awesome track record and I expect it to uphold that status for a very long time. After making the decision that I would attend a coding bootcamp, I did some extensive research on which would the be the best school to attend. I spent endless nights just reading blogs, quoras, and just all sorts of Q&A's, trying to stuff as much information about these "bootcamps" into my head. I eventually took up the courage to apply to DBC and I had the privilage of being accepted into such a prestigious program. Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it is extremely intense. If there was one place in the world where the words instense, stressful, and fun had to be used to describe it, that place would be Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is unique institution where they go against the system in which we were forced to learn by, and have us learn by being extremely hands-on.</p>
					<p>Engaging with new people, and making friends has never been a problem for me. But the idea of being around extremely intelligent people who share the same aspiriations as me, is a bit frightening. I just see it as my competitive nature telling me that this is absolutely for real and you have no time to be second guessing anything. I see myself fitting in really well with the DBC culture but I would be lying if I told you I wasn't nervous. No matter much mental prep I do, the fear of failure will always linger.</p>
					<p>My expectations of DBC have not changed. I have been told that it is a very intense program and I don't doubt it one bit. But the intensity is appealing and excites me that I will be part of that larger experience. Prior to Phase 0, I was pretty nervous but I can sense myself becoming more accustomed to it. I will be ready.</p>

			<div id="title">Git and Version Control - (Insert cheesy "git" pun here)</div>
				<div id="date">9/17/2014</div> 
					<div id="content"><p>"Code doesn’t exist unless it’s checked into a version control system. Use version control for everything you do. Any version control, SVN, Git, even CVS, master it and use it." - Jeff Atwood</p>
					<p>I don't see how anyone serious about programming could turn away from using version control. Version control is so benefical to developers because it allows you to create both an archive and a simple approach to undo corrupted code. Not to mention that its extremely useful when working in large groups because project members can make changes to the same repository and have it merged after it commits. Version control opens up whole new opportunities to experiment a little more with projects without running into any repercussions. We all know that feeling way too well when you are deeply invested into a project, almost at the finish line but you run into a problem that is irreparable at that point. Version control allows you to undo adverse changes and create a smoother workflow.</p>
					<p>brb, installing Git for real life.</p>
					<p>Out of all the wonderful VCS(version control systems) applications out there, Git is the most prominent one. Git helps me keep track of changes in my code because it retains all the history of my files. This gives me the ability to see the changes I've made over time and roll back any changes I don't find appropriate. Git has built in commands in which you can check the log of all the changes made to a specific repositories. Since Git uses more than just one repository, it's utilized a lot more in all kinds of ways. Git allows you to have your own privary repository in which you can make changes to without having to merge your work to the central repository.</p>
					<p>GitHub currently is the trendiest web-based code hosting server out there. It makes sense to use Github to store your code because it has the largest userbase, which means there are a lot more opensource projects available to you. When making any big decisions between two products that you like, you want to always go with the one with the better track record. I expect myself to stick to GitHub for as long I am a software developer and don't plan on making any changes any time soon.</p></div>

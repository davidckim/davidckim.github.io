		<div id="title">DBC Kitchen vs. Table</div> <!-- insert title here -->
				<div id="date">9/19/2014</div> <!-- insert your date here -->
					<div id="content"><p>Dev Bootcamp has an awesome track record and I expect it to uphold that status for a very long time. After making the decision that I would attend a coding bootcamp, I did some extensive research on which would the be the best school to attend. I spent endless nights just reading blogs, quoras, and just all sorts of Q&A's, trying to stuff as much information about these "bootcamps" into my head. I eventually took up the courage to apply to DBC and I had the privilage of being accepted into such a prestigious program. Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it is extremely intense. If there was one place in the world where the words instense, stressful, and fun had to be used to describe it, that place would be Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is unique institution where they go against the system in which we were forced to learn by, and have us learn by being extremely hands-on.</p>
					<p>Engaging with new people, and making friends has never been a problem for me. But the idea of being around extremely intelligent people who share the same aspiriations as me, is a bit frightening. I just see it as my competitive nature telling me that this is absolutely for real and you have no time to be second guessing anything. I see myself fitting in really well with the DBC culture but I would be lying if I told you I wasn't nervous. No matter much mental prep I do, the fear of failure will always linger.</p>
					<p>My expectations of DBC have not changed. I have been told that it is a very intense program and I don't doubt it one bit. But the intensity is appealing and excites me that I will be part of that larger experience. Prior to Phase 0, I was pretty nervous but I can sense myself becoming more accustomed to it. I will be ready.</p>

			<div id="title">Git and Version Control - (Insert cheesy "git" pun here)</div>
				<div id="date">9/17/2014</div> 
					<div id="content"><p>"Code doesn’t exist unless it’s checked into a version control system. Use version control for everything you do. Any version control, SVN, Git, even CVS, master it and use it." - Jeff Atwood</p>
					<p>I don't see how anyone serious about programming could turn away from using version control. Version control is so benefical to developers because it allows you to create both an archive and a simple approach to undo corrupted code. Not to mention that its extremely useful when working in large groups because project members can make changes to the same repository and have it merged after it commits. Version control opens up whole new opportunities to experiment a little more with projects without running into any repercussions. We all know that feeling way too well when you are deeply invested into a project, almost at the finish line but you run into a problem that is irreparable at that point. Version control allows you to undo adverse changes and create a smoother workflow.</p>
					<p>brb, installing Git for real life.</p>
					<p>Out of all the wonderful VCS(version control systems) applications out there, Git is the most prominent one. Git helps me keep track of changes in my code because it retains all the history of my files. This gives me the ability to see the changes I've made over time and roll back any changes I don't find appropriate. Git has built in commands in which you can check the log of all the changes made to a specific repositories. Since Git uses more than just one repository, it's utilized a lot more in all kinds of ways. Git allows you to have your own privary repository in which you can make changes to without having to merge your work to the central repository.</p>
					<p>GitHub currently is the trendiest web-based code hosting server out there. It makes sense to use Github to store your code because it has the largest userbase, which means there are a lot more opensource projects available to you. When making any big decisions between two products that you like, you want to always go with the one with the better track record. I expect myself to stick to GitHub for as long I am a software developer and don't plan on making any changes any time soon.</p></div>

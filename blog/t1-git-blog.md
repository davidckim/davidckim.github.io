# Git and Version Control - (Insert cheesy "git" pun here)
#### Date 9/17/2014

What are the benefits of version control?

"Code doesn’t exist unless it’s checked into a version control system. Use version control for everything you do. Any version control, SVN, Git, even CVS, master it and use it." - Jeff Atwood

I don't see how anyone serious about programming could turn away from using version control. Version control is so benefical to developers because it allows you to create both an archive and a simple approach to undo corrupted code. Version control opens up whole new opportunities to experiment a little more with projects without running into any repercussions. We all know that feeling way too well when you are deeply invested into a project, almost at the finish line but you run into a problem that is irreparable at that point. Version control allows you to undo adverse changes and create a smooth workflow.

brb, installing Git for real life.

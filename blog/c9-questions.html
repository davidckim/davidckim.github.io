					<p>DBC Google Community has been too good to me. I have always received the best help and answers even though I wasn't too specific and concise in my questions. I admit, when I seek out for help, I would always be concerned with keeping my questions short. In a way, I would feel guilty for taking up too much time from my peers, so I would keep it simple.
					</p>
					<p>Asking the right questions is just as important as you receiving the right answers. Nobody will sympathize with you if you ask a vague question but expected an in-depth beautifully thought out answer. Even small things such as grammar and spelling will leave a good impression to a reader and take you a lot more seriously. Remember, the more effort you put into your questions, then most likely the reader will put in the same amount of effort to help you find a solution. In a situation where the prompt format in where you want to ask a question requires a title, write a title that will attract readers to help you. This means to be specific and intuitive.

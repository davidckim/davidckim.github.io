					<p>I am a abstract random and concrete random thinker. In a way, these two different kind of styles of thinking contradict each other, but I wouldn't say that I am two-face, it just means I am flexible in the way I approach things... hopefully. From what I read up on so far, an abstract random learner enjoys working in groups in noncompetitive atmospheres but concrete random learners are competitive and rather work independently. In some ways, this actually makes perfect sense to me. I often have struggles with my tendencies and motivation week by week and it can either be an abstract random learning or concrete learning. When I first found out what my learning styles were, I sat there scratching my head wondering how I could be two very different learning styles that clearly contradict each other. But when I started looking deeper into it, they are in some ways pretty similar. Concrete random learners like producing imaginative products, which is in some ways similar to abstract random thinkers who have imaginativve artistic expression.</p>
					<p>My biggest struggle so far in Phase 0 DBC has been trying to cram everything in such a short period of time. My biggest motivation so far has been trying not to fall behind. Seeing how our cohort has so many brilliant minds, falling behind is as real as it gets. I see my fellow cohort members as my colleagues and family who will go through the same struggles as I do, but they are also my competition. (BOOM! Abstract random and concrete random in action.)</p>

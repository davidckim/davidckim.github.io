					<p>I am pretty sure many of you have heard the term "RAM" not only for computers but also for hand held devices. RAM is a whole lot different from a harddrive. The name itself does a good job of explaining what RAM is, it as a random memory that your computer accesses. Everything from your operating system to a CD-ROM uses your RAM to run properlly.</p>
					<p>Lets compare RAM can also be compared to a person's short term memory. For instance, most likely you do not remember what you had for breakfast 7 months ago on a certain day and time. RAM is used to focus on certain applications being run then it just refreshes when it is done being used. A good way to think of it is as if a bucket had a hole in at the bottom which causes it to drain but there is water being poured into it constantly so it never becomes empty. New water gets poured into the bucket then refreshes constantly. The water in this case would the amount of memory(water) that is needed to run. </p>
